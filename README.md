# Hybrid Ring-Ledger-Platform-
Ring ledger enables a scalable, resilient, hybrid on-chain/off-chain revocation system and fast distributed ledger that uniquely leverages ring topology and token-passing consensus to support multiple simultaneous processes, localized offline networks, and human-interactive systems in a way that prior blockchain and network solutions have not achieved.
Regulatory -mutable personal data flows through the Hybrid Ring Ledger architecture:

Immutable Layer anchors permanent claims like genomic fingerprints, notarized credentials, and timestamped attestations.
Mutable Layer handles personal information subject to updates or erasure — such as sleep scores, addresses, or engagement metrics.
Ringlet Governance Modules sit between the layers, enforcing mutability policies per domain (e.g. health, identity, finance).
API Endpoints for disclosure and erasure allow users and regulators to interact with mutable data while preserving audit trails.
